# Full Stack Group Project Track  
---

# Track 1: Tackling Generative AI Consequences
**Problem 1:** 
There’s no easy way for local Chicago creators to track or flag unauthorized use of their work on social media platforms.

**Solution 1:** 
Build a web app where users can upload their artwork and use a simple image-matching tool to flag potential unauthorized use in AI-generated content online.

---

# Track 2: Technology for Public Goods 

**Problem 2:**
UIC students, especially first-generation and commuter students from diverse backgrounds, struggle to find affordable campus resources like free tutoring, mental health drop-ins, or cultural events due to fragmented information, leading to isolation and lower engagement.

**Solution 2:** 
A web app called the UIC Student Resource Connector that provides a searchable list of UIC-specific resources (e.g., tutoring, Latino Cultural Center events) and a request board for students to post needs (e.g., "Looking for a Spanish convo partner"), fostering community and accessibility.

**Problem 3:** 
In many neighborhoods, food waste is high while there are so many families that struggle with food insecurity.

**Solution 3:**  
Build a food sharing platform in the form of a web + mobile app that connects restaurants, grocery stores, and households with local shelters or community members in need.

# Track 3: Creative Coding and Cultural Expression

**Idea - Story - Inspiration 4:**
Music and art are both ways people express themselves, and I wanted to combine the two into a playful, interactive experience.

**Implementation 4:**
Develop a web app where each keyboard key (or mouse click) plays a sound and simultaneously creates a colorful shape or brushstroke on the screen

**Idea - Story - Inspiration 5:**
This project is inspired by the idea of turning simple doodles into something artistic and relaxing, while also showing how math and symmetry can create beauty.

**Implementation 5:**
Develop an app where the user can draw with their mouse, and every stroke is mirrored across multiple axes in real time, forming a kaleidoscope or mandala effect.


# Idea Finalization

**From 5 project ideas you have above, please choose one of the project that you are going with for the rest of the semester. Explain why you are going with that project**
We will be going with Track 2 - Problem 2 as it can be benificial to the UIC community gaining more access and information on local events or resources.
